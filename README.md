PROJECT TITLE: SIMPLE CALCULATOR USING PYTHON
DESCRIPTION :This is a simple calculator program written in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program allows the user to choose an operation, input two numbers, and then displays the result.

KEY FEATURES:
Operations: The user can choose from four operations: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.
Input Handling: The program accepts both integer and floating-point numbers as inputs.
Error Handling: It includes error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs (e.g., entering non-numeric values).
Repeat Functionality: After each calculation, the user is prompted to perform another operation, allowing for continuous use until the user decides to exit.

TECH STACK:
1. Programming Language:
Python 3.x: The primary language used to write the calculator. Python is a versatile, easy-to-learn, and powerful programming language widely used for both beginners and advanced users.
2. Libraries/Modules:
No external libraries required: The calculator program uses only Python's built-in functions and basic control structures, such as input(), print(), and exception handling (try-except), meaning no additional external libraries or frameworks are required.
3. Development Environment: Any Python-compatible IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE)
4. Version Control: Git (optional, for managing code changes)

FEATURES:
Basic Arithmetic Operations:Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User Input:Users can input two numbers and select the desired operation.
Error Handling:Handles invalid input (non-numeric values) and division by zero errors.
Continuous Calculation:After each calculation, the user is asked if they want to perform another operation.
Input Validation:Ensures the user selects a valid operation (1, 2, 3, or 4).
Flexible Number Types:Accepts both integer and floating-point numbers for calculations

HOW TO RUN :
1. Install Python (if not already installed):
If you don't have Python installed on your computer, download and install it from the official Python website:
-> "Download Python"
Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH during installation (this is typically an option in the installation wizard).
2. Create a Python File:
Open a text editor or IDE (such as VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE).
Create a new Python file with a .py extension, e.g., calculator.py.
3. Copy and Paste the Code:
Copy the entire code for the calculator from the earlier message and paste it into your new Python file (calculator.py).
4. Save the File:
Save the file after pasting the code.
5. Run the Python File
  * Run the Python script by typing:
              python calculator.py
6. Interacting with the Program:
Once the program runs, follow the prompts in the terminal or console:
Select the operation (e.g., 1 for addition).
Enter the two numbers when prompted.
The program will display the result.
You can choose to perform another calculation or exit the program.

EXAMPLE:
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): yes
